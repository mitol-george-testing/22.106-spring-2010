Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and methods of transport theory needed in neutron science applications. This course is a foundational study of the effects of multiple interactions on neutron distributions and their applications to problems across the Nuclear Engineering department. Stochastic and deterministic simulation techniques will be introduced to the students.

### Assignments

There will be a total of 6 homework assignments. The due dates are indicated on the schedule of class. Some homework will require the use of computational language such as Fortran or Matlab. Students that are not familiar with such languages are encouraged to do a few [tutorials](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials.html).

### Term Paper

The goal of the 22.106 project is to give the student the opportunity to learn on their own and transmit this knowledge in a written 10 page report. The student is encouraged to pick a topic of their interest, but this topic must go beyond what is thought in the current Nuclear Engineering curriculum. The student may not pick a topic directly related to their current of previous research. Please keep in mind that the subject must be related to Neutron Interactions and Applications. A list of possible topics will be handed out towards mid-February, but students are encouraged to come up with their own original ideas. Topics must be selected by Ses #9 and final reports are due in Ses #24.

MIT Statement on Plagiarism
---------------------------

Plagiarism—use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement—is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/) and [the MIT Web site on Plagiarism](http://web.mit.edu/writing/Special/plagiarism.html).
